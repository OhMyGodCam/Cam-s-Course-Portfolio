# Module 03: GitHub and Google Colab Notebooks

## Summary
This module introduced us to GitHub and Jupyter Notebooks using Google Colab. I learned how to create repositories, use GitHub Desktop to manage files, and upload `.ipynb` notebooks from Colab to GitHub. It was a challenge at first, but with group help and practice, it became easier.

## Key Concepts
- Creating and cloning GitHub repositories
- Using GitHub Desktop to push and pull files
- Creating `.ipynb` notebooks in Google Colab
- Collaborating with team members on shared repos

## Reflection
This assignment helped me gain confidence in using GitHub and working with Jupyter Notebooks. Even though I got stuck a few times, I had great support from my team and learned the importance of persistence and collaboration. I also learned how important it is to follow steps carefully and take my time when learning something new.
