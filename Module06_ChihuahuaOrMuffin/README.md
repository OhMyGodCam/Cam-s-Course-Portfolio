# Module 06: Chihuahua or Muffin? - Neural Network Image Classification

## Summary
This module introduced the fundamentals of neural networks through a hands-on, team-based image classification challenge. We were tasked with training a model to distinguish between chihuahuas and muffins — two visually similar images that test the capability of neural networks to detect nuanced features.

As a team, we cloned the project from GitHub and worked in Google Colab to run and debug the provided `workshop_1.ipynb` notebook. We had to make a number of fixes to get the code running properly, from importing key libraries like PyTorch and torchvision to correcting issues in data loaders, transformations, and model definitions.

The neural network we implemented consisted of multiple layers and used a feedforward structure to train on labeled image data. We applied data preprocessing like image resizing and normalization, used image folders to separate training and validation data, and visualized the model’s predictions to evaluate its performance. Backpropagation, loss functions (CrossEntropyLoss), and optimizers (SGD) were also used to improve the model’s accuracy.

In my role, I worked through many of the code sections manually and documented each major step from data loading to model evaluation. Despite some initial errors, repetition and collaboration helped me understand how neural networks use layers, weights, and activation functions to make decisions. I saw firsthand how small adjustments — like image transforms or batch size — could affect performance.

This project made neural networks feel less abstract. Seeing how a model learns to classify tricky images helped me better understand activation functions, layers, and the importance of good data preparation. I’m excited to go deeper into CNNs and transfer learning in the next modules.
