# Module 04: Fundamentals of Image Processing

## Summary
In this module, we explored the fundamentals of image processing, including digital image formats, pixel values, color models, and common enhancement techniques. We also reviewed real-world applications and the role of tools like OpenCV and Pillow in Python for processing and analyzing images.

## Key Topics Covered
- Grayscale and RGB image structures
- Image formats (JPEG, PNG, TIFF, BMP)
- Image enhancement: histogram equalization, blurring, sharpening
- Image segmentation: thresholding, edge detection, clustering
- Image restoration: noise reduction, deblurring, inpainting
- Libraries: OpenCV and Pillow

## Reflection
This module gave me a clear understanding of how computers “see” images through pixel values and color channels. I enjoyed learning how OpenCV and Pillow are used in real-world applications like facial recognition and object detection. The creative "Adventure Quest" helped me understand and express these ideas in a fun and personal way.
