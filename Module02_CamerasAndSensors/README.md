# Module 02: Cameras and Sensors

## Summary
In this module, we explored the types of cameras and sensors used in computer vision systems. We learned how resolution, frame rate, and field of view directly affect the performance of AI models. Sensor technologies like LiDAR and radar were also discussed.

## Key Topics Covered
- RGB, Depth, Thermal, and Stereo Cameras
- Camera Specifications: Resolution, Frame Rate, Field of View
- LiDAR and Radar Sensors
- Camera Calibration & Setup

## Reflection
Even though there was no assignment, this module helped me understand the importance of good image input and calibration. I now see how sensors and camera placement can make or break the success of a computer vision system. It also made me think more about the physical side of AI, not just the code.
